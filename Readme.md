This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using Python and Tkinter. Players can select "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors," and the computer randomly generates its own choice. The game displays the result – Win, Lose, or Tie – with an interactive UI featuring distinct colors and a dark theme. Perfect for a quick and fun coding project!
